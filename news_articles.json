Apple TV+ is a home to some of the best TV shows and movies, including hits like Ted Lasso, Severance, and more. However, until now, the Apple TV+ app has been exclusive to the Apple ecosystem, with only limited availability on Android via the Android TV app and the Apple TV+ website.\nThis means Apple has been sitting out on the potential audience of roughly 3.9 billion Android smartphone users (via BankMyCell) due to the lack of a dedicated app. Well, it seems that Apple has finally realized this, as according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is finally bringing its Apple TV+ service as an app to Android.\nRelated Enjoy Apple TV+ movies and shows even when you are offline! The report is based on the job listing posted by Apple in recent days, which says that Apple is looking for a senior Android software engineer to join the Apple TV app team. The engineer, according to the listing, will lead the development of 'fun new features' and 'help build an application used by millions to watch and discover TV and sports.'\nThis suggests that Apple might be warming up to the idea of opening its app to its rival OS, Android, possibly to gain market share in video streaming or due to regulatory pressures like the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) that forced Apple to allow sideloading app stores and adopt RCS on iPhone. Whatever the reason, it seems like the Apple TV+ app on Android could become a reality soon.\nApple provides only a handful of apps on Android\nUnlike Google, which offers a large catalog of apps on iOS, Apple has only a few apps available on Android. These include Apple Music, Apple Music Classical, Move to iOS, Tracker Detect, and a few others. While an Apple TV app does exist on the Play Store \u2014 in fact, there are two separate listings \u2014 this version is only for Android TV and lacks support for phones or tablets. Meanwhile, Apple has declined to release apps like FaceTime and iMessage on Android, but it now seems that Apple TV+ could soon join the list of Apple apps available on Android.\nIn contrast to other streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, or Hulu, which offer ad-supported or lower-quality streaming subscription tiers, Apple TV+ has only a single subscription tier that costs $10 a month. The service is completely ad-free, with most shows available in HDR. With Apple's WWDC 2024 coming up in just over a week, we might get a sneak peek of this Android app at the event \u2014 who knows?", "word_count": 491, "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@sanujbhatiaa", "all_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-29/apple-signals-that-it-s-working-on-tv-app-for-android-phones", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/careers", "https://www.pushbullet.com/channel-popup?tag=androidpolicefeed ", "https://www.instagram.com/sanujbhatia/", "https://www.tiktok.com/@realandroidpolice", "https://twitter.com/AndroidPolice", "https://www.facebook.com/AndroidPolice", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/privacy-policy", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/terms-of-use", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/editorial-integrity", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanujbhatia/", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/advertising", "https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-android-users-are-there", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.sony.appletv", "https://www.valnetinc.com/en/", "https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200551832/android-software-engineer-apple-tv-app", "https://www.youtube.com/AndroidPolice", "https://twitter.com/sanujbhatiaa/", "https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBggKMLuYFDDSzAI", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv", "https://www.instagram.com/androidpolice/"], "all_domain_links": ["google.com", "tiktok.com", "valnetinc.com", "apple.com", "bloomberg.com", "bankmycell.com", "instagram.com", "pushbullet.com", "twitter.com", "linkedin.com", "facebook.com", "youtube.com"], "id": "dda1ae05b8ac13a262e1508a3947ca50", "score": 10.748032}, {"title": "How to turn off Apple Watch's passcode feature", "author": "Parth Shah", "authors": ["Parth Shah"], "journalists": ["Parth Shah"], "published_date": "2024-04-10 23:42:35", "published_date_precision": "full", "updated_date": "2024-04-10 23:42:35", "updated_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-watch-turn-off-passcode-tutorial", "domain_url": "androidpolice.com", "full_domain_url": "androidpolice.com", "name_source": "Android Police", "is_headline": true, "paid_content": false, "parent_url": "https://www.androidpolice.com", "country": "CA", "rights": "androidpolice.com", "rank": 2796, "media": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/apple-watch-series-9-9-1.jpg", "language": "en", "description": "Disabling the Apple Watch passcode offers convenience, but it comes with several caveats", "content": "Apple prompts users to add a passcode to their Apple Watch to protect their personal information.

This recruit would be tasked with building 'an application used by millions to watch and discover TV and sports,' suggesting that Apple wants its TV app on Android. With a dedicated Apple TV app, Android users would be able to directly access Apple TV+, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant's streaming service, as well as entertainment titles they've rented or purchased from the storefront. Currently, those in the Android ecosystem have to either use tv.apple.com in a web browser or an Android TV device like the Chromecast with Google TV.\nTherefore, a native Apple TV app would more easily reach the millions of people who use Android devices and, in turn, could drive Apple TV+ subscriptions. The Apple TV app is currently available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, PlayStation and Xbox consoles, select smart TVs and more. Meanwhile, Apple currently only has a small selection of apps on Android, including Apple Music and Beats.\nOf course, an Apple TV app on Android is likely a while away, given that Apple is seemingly still only in the hiring phase.

Apple is reportedly exploring a built-in camera to natively support FaceTime in a future Apple TV release, an idea that might remind Xbox fans of the abandoned Kinect. Apple has already added FaceTime support with tvOS 17, which requires a compatible iPhone or iPad to stream a video call to an Apple TV, but this upgrade would make things much more seamless.\nApple is reportedly exploring a built-in camera to natively support FaceTime in a future Apple TV release, an idea that might remind Xbox fans of the abandoned Kinect. Apple has already added FaceTime support with tvOS 17, which requires a compatible iPhone or iPad to stream a video call to an Apple TV, but this upgrade would make things much more seamless. Xbox's Kinect was first launched in 2010 when Microsoft hoped the bold, motion-sensing product would usher in a new generation of home entertainment, and while it sold well initially, its popularity died out due to privacy concerns and a lack of interest from most gamers. The unfortunate timeline ended in 2022 when the Kinect's inventor left Microsoft after allegations of misconduct were levied against him. However, it seems the idea of a camera-enabled entertainment system has found a new home.\nRelated Apple is now allowing the distribution of retro game emulators through the company's App Store, with a few big caveats and conditions. A Bloomberg report states that Apple has big plans for its category of smart home products. Apparently, the tech giant is discussing a redesigned Apple TV set-top box that would include a built-in camera for both FaceTime and gesture control capabilities. Like other Apple products, the technology would be meant to work seamlessly with a user's iPhone or the new Vision Pro. According to the report, Apple has already begun testing a lightweight smart display that is part of this new family of smart home products. The displays would presumably be used as a command center for a user's relevant Apple devices. However, reportedly, the company has not yet decided whether it will move forward with the new products.\nFuture Apple TV Could Have Built-In Camera and Gesture Controls The smart home sector is a wide-reaching and potentially lucrative market for Apple to invest further in, following previous products like the HomePod, but it would have plenty of tough competition from other tech companies like Google, Amazon, and others. However, the report states that Apple's canceled electric car project and recently released Vision Pro have freed up substantial resources to develop future products.\nFor fans interested in forthcoming Apple releases, the company's WWDC24 event takes place on June 10. During it, Apple is expected to announce new software like iOS 18 and macOS 15, but hardware rumors have been scant so far.\nVR or AR fans can already get a taste of the future with Apple's highly expensive Vision Pro, which starts at $3,500 and tops out at almost $5,000 with all accessories included. Some Vision Pro owners have explained that the device is incredibly impressive thanks to its intuitive spatial control features and super precise eye tracking, but also say that the device is almost too ahead of its time, which can be seen in its exorbitant price and inconvenient features like an external battery.\nApple began as a small tech company that evolved into one of the most innovative and well-known brands in all of computing and mobile phones.

Here's everything you need to know so you can watch the keynote live.\nWhen and How to Watch Apple's \"Let Loose\" Event Apple has scheduled its \"Let Loose\" event for May 7, 2024, at 7 am PT (10 am ET). Although Apple sent invitations to select media and content creators, the invite doesn't mention an in-person component like the upcoming WWDC 2024 event.

Take a moment to look at the artistic logo Apple made for the event, and you'll see the Apple Pencil.\nIt's unlikely that Apple will hold an event just to show off a new third-generation Apple Pencil. And considering Apple hasn't introduced any new iPads since late 2022, it's safe to assume this is an iPad-focused event.\nEarlier in March 2024, expert analysts like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman predicted the launch of new iPad Pro models in May. These models are expected to feature all-new OLED displays, M3 chips, and landscape-oriented Face ID cameras in a thinner chassis, which will be tempting to buyers looking for a high-end device.\nAlongside the iPad Pro models, the iPad Air is also expected to get a hardware refresh with the M2 chip. Back in September 2023, Gurman also shared Apple's plans to launch an all-new Magic Keyboard for iPads with an aluminum base in Bloomberg's Power On newsletter. Apple could introduce it alongside the new iPads.\nAs you can see, there's a lot to look forward to at this event.

But you might still want to keep iTunes around. Apple's Apps to Replace iTunes Are Available on the Microsoft Store In February 2024, Apple released a trio of Windows apps to phase out iTunes. These include Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Devices. This move is similar to how Apple removed iTunes from macOS in 2019. If you're unsure, here's a quick rundown of these Apple apps and what they're useful for: Apple Music: If you've been using iTunes to listen to songs on Apple Music, you'll need this dedicated app. Besides streaming Apple Music content, you can access your entire iCloud Music Library. You can import locally stored songs and store them on iCloud.\nIf you've been using iTunes to listen to songs on Apple Music, you'll need this dedicated app. Besides streaming Apple Music content, you can access your entire iCloud Music Library.

Apple's standalone apps for Windows have been available as a preview since January 2023, but they're now available to the general public. Alongside these iTunes replacements, Apple also introduced a revamped iCloud app for Windows users. The release of these standalone Apple apps for Windows devices doesn't mean iTunes is completely useless. You'll still need it if you want to access your audiobooks on your PC or listen to free podcasts. Apple has yet to release a standalone Apple Podcasts app we're familiar with on macOS. When I opened iTunes on my Windows PC, the app prompted me to switch to Apple's standalone apps, and everything was removed except podcasts and audiobooks. However, this wasn't the case for Windows users who downloaded iTunes from the Microsoft Store instead of Apple's iTunes download page. For now, you should think twice before uninstalling iTunes from your Windows computer. If you've never used iTunes to listen to podcasts or audiobooks, you can finally say goodbye and switch to Apple's standalone apps.
